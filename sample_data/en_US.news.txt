The first is the love of self and the second, the love of money. Two Greek words, philautos and philargyros, succinctly express these concepts. Both, I detect, lie at the root of the world's problems. Certainly, this diagnosis is not novel. Why then are these destructive personality traits chronic in the human experience? Further, why are people who possess these attributes permitted to run rampant through communities and societies to the detriment of the greater population? The Protester seeks to curb the second phenomenon.
"Looking back on it now, I realize that if I would have stayed there, it would have gotten worse and I wouldn't be where I am now."

The sisters didn't even know where he was buried. After their mother died in 2009, they started searching the Internet for any information on Moszek "Mike" Zanger. They soon learned more than their mother ever knew about his final months, thanks to the dogged work of a pair of World War II buffs.
That information, and more, is available from the agency that regulates doctors, the state Board of Professional Registration for the Healing Arts.

Yet some hospitals do make it easier. On its website, Huntington Memorial Hospital in Pasadena allows people to select several common procedures and get an instant price quote, including an estimate of the patient's share after plugging in their deductible and coinsurance. But even those numbers exclude the thousands of dollars that physicians, anesthesiologists and other specialists would tack on for most surgeries.

But what's most amazing about "American Reunion" is its absolute lack of tonal control. Scenes will wander from gross-out gag to sentimental schmaltz to pervy leer to cheap nostalgia within a 30-second span, utterly free of clear directorial guidance. Even worse, very little of it is remotely funny.

Not all the members of UMDNJ's board of trustees supported the action. Robert DelTufo, a long-time member of the board and its former head, lashed out in an e-mail to Owen sent to the rest of the trustees. In the e-mail, forwarded to The Star-Ledger by one of the recipients, DelTufo accused Owen of having "improperly usurped the role of the board of trustees" and delivering a message contrary to the board's position.
"It is surely within the legitimate purview of a district superintendent to investigate whether any discontent in a district is limited to particular schools or whether it is evenly spread throughout a district," Sills wrote in the 36-page ruling.

This coffee table book — released just in time for Tuesday's home opener marking the 50th anniversary of Dodger Stadium, is divided into nine chapters — you expected a different number in a baseball book? — and range from the early Brooklyn years to the Dodgers' recent move of their spring training home from Vero Beach, Fla., to Arizona. There are two chapters on Brooklyn, including an essay by Roger Kahn (author of "The Boys of Summer") and seven on the Dodgers in Los Angeles, mostly divided by decades.

Chiarelli said he is "not inclined" to trade a goalie â€” Thomas â€” but you can bet he will explore precisely that. He'd be nuts not to. Thomas has one year left on his contract, with a $5 million cap hit but just $3 million salary. His no-trade/no-movement clause is gone as of July 1.

Years of experience have taught me that real reconciliation cannot occur without two essential ingredients: trust and truth. Saakashvili, with his campaign of lies and his refusal to give up violence against my people, has ensured that neither of those elements exist. Until the world hears our story and acknowledges what really happened on Aug. 7, there is no way for "justice" to be served.
Syracuse has reached the Final Four on four occasions. The Orange won their national title in 2003, with a roster including Carmelo Anthony, Hakim Warrick and Gerry McNamara.

Chairs, the one category of furniture that shares the kind of intimacy with the human body as the bed, lend themselves to anthropomorphic interpretation. They have legs, arms, seats, backs and headrests, and Wagner has arranged them provocatively to suggest conviviality, rejection, hostility and chaos.

The late surge before the caucuses for Santorum was the first exhibit, Crawford said. Since then, Republicans elected no self-identified Romney supporters to the Iowa GOP state central committee, Ron Paul backers made a successful play to gain ground within the party structure, the two national committee representatives and state chair refused to sign a delegate loyalty pledge, the party booked a fundraising keynote speaker who has said hes not enthused about Romney, and various outspoken activists have expressed their reluctance about him.
If the deal with Dawson is finalized, it could be a good first step in reorganizing the company, city officials said.
The Institute for Supply Management's better-than-expected report, improving manufacturing data overseas and a surprise jump in U.S. construction spending in June, helped push stock markets higher. Following last week's report that the U.S. economy shrank less than expected in the second quarter, many economists believe the longest recession since World War II may be over, though any recovery will be subdued.

Consumer spending is rising because the vast majority of working-age Americans are now breathing easier, despite 9.4 percent unemployment. People who had jobs feared being laid off during the recession, which ended in June 2009, and for months after. Fewer worry now, because most companies have stopped cutting staff.

"Where the Wild Things Are," about a boy named Max who goes on a journey — sometimes a rampage — through his own imagination after he is sent to bed without supper, was quite controversial when it was published, and his quirky and borderline scary illustrations for E.T.A.

His team felt differently – that was clear by how they reacted to the victory. They rushed closer Reynaldo Hernandez after he punctuated the victory by striking out Castano. Minutes later, they dumped the Gatorade bucket on Mandl and whatever was left on Corniel. It had nothing to do with the opponent, Rodriguez said. It was about winning a title.

It's the reason Mayor Chuck Reed and his council allies are backing a June 5 ballot measure that would reform pension costs, though the exact ballot language has been temporarily put on hold by an appellate court.
Ohio is on the right track with these bills. Pension forfeiture should be the rule, not the exception, when someone who is supposed to be serving the public betrays the public instead. The public should not have to finance the retirement of an employee or officeholder guilty of malfeasance.

In the first half of 2011, single-copy sales tumbled 17 percent. In the second half, sales were down 10 percent, to 469,544. Although the bulk of Glamour's 2,353,863 total circulation comes from subscriptions, newsstand sales are big enough that the declines are worrisome.
The Fed cut its forecast for economic growth for this year to a range of 2.7 percent to 2.9 percent. It had previously expected the economy to grow 3.1 percent to 3.3 percent this year. The Fed also said unemployment would stay higher than it had expected earlier.

Corruption is embedded in China's unique approach to economic and political governance. When China began to experiment with capitalism in the late 20th century, many government officials became entrepreneurs. The Communist Party also encouraged local officials to compete for investment. These local officials gained enormous power, which they used to demand bribes, distribute resources and provide favors.

Johnson said the goal is to create a waterfront where people can "live, work and play."
Such pettifogging laws reflect, aside from the joy governments derive from bossing people around, the current rage for regulating political speech lest . . . what? Campaign regulations usually focus on money, supposedly to prevent quid pro quo corruption or the appearance thereof pertaining to candidates. But many laws cover activities involving ballot measures, which suggests that for reformers, limiting political speech is itself the goal. Hence their obsession with political money, most of which funds the dissemination of speech.
You hear it when automakers talk privately with their competitors, and it's popular with auto critics. The thinking is that no one wants to be seen about town in a vehicle with all the pizazz of a washing machine or toaster.
Creme brulee. Once the cream is heated, add flavorings like coffee, lavender, or savories such as butternut squash. Cover the pot, turn off the heat and allow the cream to infuse for at least 10 to 20 minutes. For stronger flavors, Citizen Cake's Elizabeth Falkner suggests an additional step: Leave the flavoring in the cream, cool, cover and store overnight in the refrigerator before straining and reheating. For a perfect creme brulee that is creamy and delicate, it is imperative to not over mix or over bake it. Baking should always be done in a water bath to allow even cooking and to prevent a crust from forming.
Sergeant Tim Gerding, head of the city's detective bureau, said of the case, "This one really touched me. They prey on the elderly.

The claim: Suzanne Kosmas is no moderate. She's a Nancy Pelosi "liberal Democrat." This is one of Adams' favorite claims. But it's a stretch. The widely respected National Journal described Kosmas one of the 10 most moderate members of the entire U.S. House. Kosmas sided with Republicans on everything from estate taxes to opposing high-profile pork in Democratic districts. OpenCongress.org said she voted with John Boehner 58 percent of the time. Kosmas is certainly more liberal than most Republicans. But anyone trying to portray her as a flaming lefty is being disingenuous.
Kazmi, 52, of Rochester Hills, sat quietly until his case was called Thursday afternoon in U.S. District Court in downtown Detroit. He said little and offered no plea when federal Magistrate R.

The Newman Farm Pork 2 Ways has been on the menu since the restaurant opened. I recently tasted iteration No. 15, a lustrous citrus-juniper brined pork rib eye and a tender shoulder braised in a concoction of house-made sweet vermouth and sumac-infused bourbon with toasty notes.
Only the city manager, Bonaparte, can fire Lee or ask for his resignation, and he gave no indication he planned to do so. But as speaker after speaker, black and white, took to the microphone to question why Zimmerman had not been arrested, it was clear that Bonaparte faced pressure that showed no sign of diminishing.

Even though spinal stenosis is caused by arthritis in the back, back pain is not the most common symptom. People with spinal stenosis most often notice pain in the buttocks, along with weakness, numbness or pain in their legs when they stand, walk or try to lie flat. The symptoms generally go away when they sit or bend over because those positions move the arthritic joints away from the nerves, increasing space in the canal.

The Silver Dollar: If you want straight whiskey in the new Louisville, this is the place. Dozens of whiskeys (and tequilas) line the shelves behind the bar, and they arrive both in an ambitious cocktail list and on their own. Silver Dollar fashions itself a modern honky-tonk, featuring a large American flag across a brick wall (likely more for the motif than patriotism), country music spinning from a turntable and barbecue in the kitchen. It attracts a young and boisterous crowd. Think of it as Meat's fun younger brother. 1761 Frankfort Ave., 502-259-9540; http://www.whiskeybythedrink.com

Like all memorable sports documentaries — and this Oscar-nominated film is definitely one of those — "Undefeated" is really an examination not of how games are won and lost but how lives are lived, how young people faced with daunting challenges come to see, often in the most dramatic fashion, what is important going forward and what is not.

What sends the body moving are the legs, and this jump leads with downstage leg (the one closer to the audience), which crosses the body, suggesting the forward motion of a kid running down the block. By contrast, in ballet it is the upstage leg that often leads in the traditional leap (the grande jete), so the body can appear as taut and elongated as possible. "The choice was to have it crossed, so it didn't have the length and line that a normal jete would," Mr. Gattelli said.
Yet Marylanders could show Will and Kate a jolly good time, too, if given the royal nod. From pub crawling and shopping on Thames Street in Fells Point, to steeplechase races in Cockeysville, not to mention locales with royal pedigree — think Annapolis and Queen Anne's County — there's plenty here to remind them of Merry Old England. We even have castles.
If the first operation is a success, Ronderos said, she will need several more. Still, the girl's upcoming trip to Bogota for surgery comes as a "total surprise, a gift from God," her father said. "We thought there were no options."
Disney is the leader when it comes to promoting and branding its characters. Just wait until the Marvel universe has access to the Disney marketing.

Those sums pale beside the largest dues deal that Hodgson found: Comerica paid $202,928, including an initiation fee, for CEO Ralph Babb to join a club in Dallas. Babb, incidentally, is a former St. Louisan; he once worked for Mercantile Bank. Comerica received a cash infusion from the U.S. Treasury's TARP program, and TARP requires recipients to have a "luxury expenditures policy." Apparently, though, it doesn't require them to quit paying for luxuries.

The benefits of direct job creation aren't just transitory. It's well documented that persistent unemployment results in a permanent loss of output and labor productivity.

On the flip side, a different reason I'm fine with The Rock staying away for periods of time is because I'm already starting to remember why I got tired of The Rock in the first place â€“ The Attitude Era, as successful as it was, was also the era of overbearing repetition. Even with new catchphrases and techniques, The Rock has already become stale in certain areas. For example, the "(insert phrase here)?

If we can agree that the 1962 Mets were the gold standard (or the zinc standard, perhaps) for ineptitude, there are several candidates for which one comes next.

As do just about any team from 1963-67, though '63's 111-loss team which finished 48 games out of first place (and 15th out of ninth) merits special consideration.

At other times, such as when Tom's discontent surfaces, the film shifts to relationship drama in ways that are interesting yet out of sync with the general tone.

* Don and Megan's Short, Strange Trip: Raise your hand if you also thought the projector had gotten the reels out of order (speaking of a '60s reference) when we saw Don getting excited about heading to Howard Johnson's with Megan. It took me several moments to figure out that this was the playing-out of the fleeting reference we'd seen earlier in the episode, as Roger's LSD storyline was beginning. Anyway, Don once again bullies past Megan's protestations -- she feels bad ditching Peggy and the rest of the Heinz team -- and insists she accompany him on the trip to Howard Johnson's. She complies, but is clearly not happy. As Don, in his own world of domestic bliss, tells her she must try the orange sherbet, she objects to his smoking in the car. And things go downhill from there. At the blandly cheery HoJo's, Don keeps wanting things his way, until Megan finally blows up. "Maybe you could make up a schedule for me so I'll know when I'm working, and when I'm the wife," she says. The fight continues to the parking lot, with Megan saying, "Get in the car, eat ice cream, leave work, take off your dress. Yes, master!" So much for the newlywed glow Roger had so envied. Instead of talking it out, Don gets in the car, and drives off, leaving Megan in the parking lot. Once he cools off and returns, she's gone. He waits, getting more frazzled by the moment, at HoJo's, but there's no sign of Megan. Finally, seven hours later, he heads home, and finds Megan there. They fight again, her yelling at him for leaving her there, him saying he thought she was dead. She tries to run away, but he follows her, and they both tumble onto the carpet. But the mood is very different from the beginning of the season, when we saw them in this same position after having had sex.

"Photo enforcement has a greater deterrent effect if drivers are aware it's out there," said Police Chief Ken Johnson. "The Fairview Police Department wants to make sure that drivers know we are using photo enforcement and that they have time to learn about this new safety program.

But I can't recommend the Vitello Alla Pizziola ($31). Although the veal scallops were sauteed to succulence, the concentrated intensity of tomato, olives and herbs overwhelmed the meat's mild flavor. I'll chalk that up to personal preference, though as a chef I'd reconsider this equation.

The show also shared some of the shortcomings of horror movies. Odd Future's emphasis on nonstop outrage can feel monotonous; the umpteenth exhortation to kill people and burn stuff doesn't have anywhere near the same power to shock that the first one does. The show started off so frenetic -- Hodgy Beats pitched himself into the crowd during a performance of Mellowhype's hit "64," losing his microphone in the process -- that the pace was difficult to sustain. This would bode ill for Odd Future's career if there was nothing to the act but shock value. Yet even as they're driving the censors batty, the group is artful: the productions, mostly by Tyler and Left Brain, are musically adventurous and sometimes gorgeous in their cobwebby creepiness. A mosh pit at the Wellmont is probably not the best place to access the subtlety of Tyler's music. But the production remains the most interesting thing about Odd Future, and it's likely going to be where Tyler concentrates his energies once he tires of all the provocation.

Compare that with "30 Rock" and Alec Baldwin's loopy ode to Dean Martin and 1960s variety shows. It was one minute long. Short. But potent. Fey managed to load more jokes into those 60 seconds - Baldwin had a field day with that cigarette, and with politically incorrect drunken asides - than anything on "SNL," where the sketches average between three and five minutes. That's staggering. Why isn't "SNL" doing shorter, punchier sketches?
* CM Punk and Chris Jericho exchanged words again this week. Punk presented a more serious side to his personality while Jericho fell into the trap I thought The Rock suffered from the past few months: His promos are becoming repetitive, and he's not really saying anything we haven't heard for weeks now.

ø•Fantasy owners might feel secure with Miami Marlins closer Heath Bell, despite his 9.53 ERA and three blown save opportunities. After all, Bell has a track record of success, and Miami just gave him a big contract. Three blown saves won't cost him his job, right? But Bell's strikeout-to-walk rate plunge - from 3.29 in 2009 to 0.71 in 2012 - suggests there's a looming opportunity here.

The Portland Jazz Festival, strapped for cash after losing its title sponsor in April, plans to stop operating as of Sept. 15. Barring a "miracle" infusion of about $100,000, the February 2009 festival -- previously slated to be the exclusive 70th anniversary celebration for seminal jazz label Blue Note -- won't happen.

We've seen the GOP convene an all-male panel to testify on women's reproductive concerns. We've seen debate over Title X, a 1970 law providing free contraception to indigent women. We've been treated to Rick Santorum's bizarre views on contraception, which he opposes because he says it doesn't work (!) and is dangerous and harmful to women, to boot.

My husband deserves the credit for coming up with the name.

I garden on the edge of what is hardy here in Portland, which is emotionally dangerous (watching plants you love die a slow death isn't something I'd recommend).

Wine of some sort has been made in North America since the 1500s. In the 1800s, there were significant commercial wineries in California, Missouri, Ohio and New York (Finger Lakes region), and those are just the biggies. Then two agricultural calamities -- Phylloxera and Pierce's Disease -- had a devastating effect on our vineyards. After that came the 18th Amendment, more commonly known as Prohibition, which pretty much took out commercial winemaking in the U.S. until the 1960s. By the '70s and '80s, advances in science and technology provided by University of California-Davis and other research facilities helped us take off in winemaking. Today (deserved or not), we hold a seat at the table of fine-wine producers around the world.

Such projects may be the group's great dilemma. State officials believe optional toll lanes are among the best tools to offer regional congestion relief, serving exactly the function the regional referendum was meant to provide.

"Because I've played with all of them so much, I can just try anything and see how it works, and I don't have to worry about getting reprimanded. It's not like it's the Juilliard String Quartet or something. So it's a really incredible learning situation for me, because I can make horrible mistakes and not be too scared."

The bottom line isn't just that prisoners, like anyone else, should have access to adequate medical care, said Caroline Isaacs, director of the American Friends Service Committee's Tucson office, which monitors state prisons.

As a rule, couture houses are secretive about their clientele. Purchasing a custom-made, five-figure piece of clothing comes with the gift of discretion, a rare commodity in our publicity-crazed world. But executives describe many of their new clients as relatively young working women—doctors, lawyers, executives—who spend their own salaries, often on daywear and not merely for special occasions like weddings and black-tie galas. One of Valentino's recent couture clients, for example, is an equestrian enthusiast who wanted a bespoke jacket to wear with her riding pants.
Suddes lamented the loss of rebels who he says are being shown the door due to term limits. I would submit that a more likely culprit of legislative ills and fewer rebels is the aggressive actions taken by both the Republican and Democratic parties to handpick candidates and involve themselves in primaries to ensure their guy or gal wins.

Vinny's extended family also shows up and treats the house to some delicious ziti and cold cuts, then Mama Guadagnino cleans the refrigerator. Vinny flirts with The Situation's sister Melissa over the phone, but when she shows up, he thinks she looks too much like The Situation and is turned off. But at the club later (where JWoww is wearing her formal panties again) they seem to hit it off. And The Situation shares with us his holy grail: Gym. Tanning. Laundry. GTL, people. GTL.

Obama also mentioned he might enjoy a shave ice, Hawaii's lighter-flaked snow cone with a rainbow of tropical flavors and toppings to choose from.

Before the full band worked with him, Perkins met with Sitek in a rehearsal space at SIR Studios in Hollywood to experiment for a couple of days.

New York's Ronettes were a quintessential R&B girl group, groomed by producer Phil Spector, whose eight-year marriage to singer Ronnie Spector of the Ronettes ended in 1974. Maybe too much is made of the fact Ronnie Spector used to be married to Phil Spector. Granted, his "wall-of-sound" productions never sounded better than they did behind this trio from the girl-group heyday. But the appeal of the Ronettes â€” formed in 1959 with Estelle Bennett (vocals), Spector (vocals), Nedra Talley (vocals) â€” also owed much to Ronnie's remarkable voice and the sublime backing harmonies of Bennett and Talley. The group released only one studio album, "Presenting the Fabulous Ronettes Featuring Veronica" in 1964

You're all about sports, and you've scored tickets to see the Clippers or Kings or Lakers at Staples Center, next to the L.A. Live entertainment complex near the southern end of downtown. Congratulations, especially if those are Laker seats. Now, there are more than a dozen restaurants and bars in L.A. Live, not to mention the Grammy Museum, a JW Marriott Hotel and a Ritz-Carlton, both of which opened in 2010. But that's not where you're sleeping. You're heading eight blocks northeast to the Los Angeles Athletic Club, which has 72 hotel rooms that many people have never heard about. From the outside, the LAAC is a humdrum hulk among the gem merchants that make up downtown's Jewelry District, but inside, it's a piece of sweat-soaked L.A. history, with two restaurants and bars, pools, weights, squash courts, basketball courts and walls crowded with fascinating old artworks and photos. Book a room and you get the same access that the club's members do. (Yes, male and female, adults and children.) The hotel rooms, upgraded from 2007-2009, are dark, woodsy and clubby. For less than the cost of a room at the Marriott or Ritz, you can walk and run in the footsteps of Esther Williams, and Johnny Weissmuller and dozens of less-celebrated Olympic medalists. ( Charlie Chaplin spent a lot of time here too.) Alas, the indoor pool's high dive is no more, but you can still peek through the underwater window that diving coaches used to watch their protégés splash down.

Wet macular degeneration progresses more rapidly than the dry kind. It's a more dangerous threat to vision loss. Only five years ago, a new drug, strictly for wet degeneration, appeared. It's Lucentis, and it's given by injection into the eye. It's not guaranteed to improve vision, but it reliably stops the progression of wet degeneration. Avastin is a more recent drug, also given by eye injection, which works much like Lucentis. It is much less expensive. A third drug, marketed this past year, is Eylea, and it, too, is an eye-injected medicine.

Six years ago, one week before Christmas, I bundled my two children on a plane and flew away from our beloved home in California. I don't think there was a single moment during that flight when at least one of us was not in tears. We were leaving behind people and places we loved, and we felt bereft, and unprepared for what lay ahead. My older daughter was seven at the time and was not a big fan of shoes; I hadn't wanted to fight with her on such an already-difficult day, and thus we arrived on a blustery, sleety, below-freezing night with her little feet shod only in bright red flip-flops. It did not seem an auspicious start.

Plus, Dodds cautions, what if the airbag deploys?
What most excites him at the moment, however, and will be his focus through the year or so it takes for the center's previously planned exhibitions to cycle through, is the development of a social practice residency program. Spiak characterizes social practice as an approach to making art that is "relationship-based" rather than "material-based," that evolves from collaboration with members of a given community and builds on the expertise these collaborators offer.

The sinner, self-avowed, is a former dolphin trainer, Ric O'Barry; he caught and trained the five dolphins who played the title role in the TV series "Flipper." The series was so popular that it spawned a vogue in marine amusement parks, which turned dolphins into entertainers.

To atone for his own role in the fateful celebrity of smaller cetaceans, Mr. O'Barry became an eco-activist, freeing captive dolphins on many occasions. As the hero of this piece, he's the leader of an expedition that uses hi-def cameras (hidden in artificial rocks by special-effects wizards at Industrial Light & Magic), hydrophones and night-vision technology to penetrate the secrecy that surrounds the horrific kill.

In the end, the restaurant comes off as amateurish and not ready for prime time. I'm not expecting three-star service. But is it too much to ask for a little common sense? Or thoughtfulness? I'd love to get a cease-and-desist order to prevent servers from continually checking in to ask if everything is "great." And the $30 corkage fee for a restaurant with such a weak wine list isn't the swiftest move either.

At its most basic, it's the story of the people's fickle love, and a patrician's discomfort with the rough-and-tumble of pragmatic politics. A dense, thoughtful exploration of themes Shakespeare explored in plays from "Richard II" to "Julius Caesar," it's difficult drama with a thoroughly unlikable protagonist at its core.

During the phone interview with a Blue Cross representative, I was asked if I have an undescended testicle or a malignancy in or near one; have used a penile implant; or plan testicular surgery, infertility treatments or related procedures. I answered no to all of those queries. What was the "underlying cause" of the erectile dysfunction? According to the specialist who first diagnosed the condition eight or nine years ago, I replied, the cause was low testosterone. I also told the interviewer that the doctor prescribed both a daily testosterone supplement and the use of Cialis or Viagra. My subsequent physicians have continued that treatment, I said.
What everyone can agree on is that we were not exactly built to sit. "We were built to stand, to move, to walk," said James Levine, a Mayo Clinic endocrinologist who is so fanatical about not sitting at work that he walks at 1 mph all day on a treadmill at his desk.

Just as people have grown understandably indisposed toward anything political, Clooney directed, produced, co-wrote and starred in the election drama "The Ides of March." Rather than play the candidate any number of people wish he were (Clooney says he's not interested in actually running for office), the actor's "Ides of March" presidential contender is about as honorable as John Edwards. And while starring in an Alexander Payne movie might initially appear risk-free, the film's cuckolded protagonist is not necessarily the type of character Clooney's peers would fight to play, and it proved to be a part Clooney said concerned him no end. "I was terrified from the moment it started," he says.
But it never seems to come easy. The scenario this time was nearly a carbon copy of the outcome Monday, when the Blues scored in the third period to win 1-0. This time, they waited even longer to hit a vein, getting Alex Pietrangelo's goal with 5:14 remaining in regulation. All the nice home records aside, Blues coach Ken Hitchcock realizes his team is skating a fine line.
Hitchcock believes parity is part of the predicament. The competitive table has never been more level in hockey. The difference between first-place and eighth-place teams in the Western Conference was 16 points; in the East, it was 17 points. The difference might be explained by injuries or sub-par stretches of performance. The differences might have been caulked with late-season trades. The differences can be incomprehensible in the playoffs, and anything seems possible.

This is something that should have been seized upon by the Republican presidential candidates. It had all the elements found in the common GOP narrative about President Barack Obama.

He was already buying and fixing up old VWs before he became an electrical engineer and cofounded Netgear ($1.18 billion in net revenue last year, according to The Wall Street Journal), so having a lot of dough doesn't explain why he owns 25 to 30 vintage VWs today.

A wild-card growth opportunity is the possibility that Apple will release its own version of a television set. To be sure, the market for TVs is much smaller than the market for handsets. Households have more smartphones than they have TV sets, typically. And they replace their handsets at a more rapid rate. Yet Apple's top-notch product designers have an opportunity to streamline complicated on-screen menus and multiple remote controls. They can also cater to a small but growing segment of consumers that watch video content, but no longer subscribe to a cable package. Any TV sales would further entrench Apple inside households, possibly spurring sales of iPhones, iPads and Macs.

The design that has emerged is in some ways a return to the sinuous forms of the firm's earliest work. It will carve the 6-acre site into a series of undulating paths, remaking the topography to offer views from the high points and more intimate sections in man-made valleys. A main path will arc from the northwest corner of the park, closest to the pier, to the center of its eastern edge, facing City Hall. A network of smaller walkways will branch off, like the veins of a leaf, from the central one.

But at the same time, Jack Britt is concerned. His son's on-field performance â€” he had 42 receptions for 775 yards and nine touchdowns last season, despite missing four games with a hamstring injury â€” has shown he can be a dominant NFL receiver.

The screenwriters, who control everything (Mr. Goddard got his start on "Buffy the Vampire Slayer," the TV series created by Mr. Whedon), have filled their film with big ideas. "The Cabin in the Woods" simultaneously celebrates and deconstructs the genre's conventions, while touching on questions of ethics as they apply to reality shows, and free will as it applies to all of us contestants in the game of real life, clinging as we do to the belief that we run our own shows. Yet the initial brilliance of the premise is eventually dulled by illogic, the whole thing proves unmanageable and the filmmakers unmanage their climactic revelation with far more zest than finesse.

WASHINGTON - It would take a mighty big pill box to hold them.
After 34 games in Portland, Felton has been another failed experiment rather than the Blazers' long-term answer at point guard. Felton is averaging a career-low 10.2 points per game, has committed 94 turnovers and is shooting a career-worst 37.6 percent from the field, including just 24.8 percent from three-point range. Felton lost his starting job in the Blazers' final game before the All-Star break and his name has started to be included in trade rumors.

Hearing about the Great Race a few days ago, Tingay signed up. The rest was ... well, pretty darn speedy. His final time was 19:48, a consistent pace of less than five minutes per mile. In other words, he was on and off the course in slightly more than 19 minutes. If that wasn't a record, it was one of the all-time fastest finishes.

For Huntington, which reported a profitable first quarter, the deal provides a tax benefit and a way to invest in communities. Affordable-housing developers rely on grants, loans, tax credits and subsidies to make low monthly rents possible at new apartments and renovated properties. Developers who obtain tax credits through the Ohio Housing Finance Agency, and comparable housing groups in other states, sell those credits to raise money for their projects. The buyers are banks and other businesses that can use the credits to offset what they owe in taxes.

Time Warner's cable TV networks, which include CNN, TBS, TNT and HBO, saw revenue grow 3 percent to $3.6 billion. The company benefited from strong ad rates, better timing of the March Madness basketball games and higher fees collected from U.S. cable and satellite TV distributors to carry the channels. That was offset partly by a decrease in content revenue; last year's quarter got a boost from licensing HBO's "Sex and the City" to other cable outlets in the U.S.
Another option: Plant your new bush or tree in potting mix in a 5-gallon or larger container. Add two spoonfuls of bone meal, but hold off on any high- nitrogen fertilizers. In spring, transplant it to its permanent location. That will allow the roots some time to develop, too.

"One minute left," yelled timekeeper Sarah Fritsche. A Team Navy member quickly sprinkled cinnamon on the whipped cream before being told to back away from the table. The judges moved in, covertly scribbling notes on their score sheets. Then they were off to the roof, where they could sample both team's dishes in private and choose a winner. Flavor and texture of the dishes would make up 70 percent of the score. The rest would be based on whether the teams made the deadline, how their dishes worked together as a menu, and presentation.

Although Loving's book tells Twain's story in chronological order, and tells it well, at crucial points it will expand its frame to show how certain themes - slavery, war, a guilty conscience, the unreliability of father figures, a pessimistic naturalism - appear, reappear and develop in Twain's life and work.

Like many places these days, Avalon, long a seaside favorite of the well-to-do, isn't seeing a a lot of home sales, period. But those that have occurred have been high enough in value to push the median price up 321 percent since 2005, an Econsult Corp. analysis of transactions in 13 Shore zip codes in Atlantic and Cape May Counties from April 1, 2005, through June 30, 2011, shows.

Just over five minutes into the game, Chris Stewart had an open net in which to deposit the puck. But in a moment that typifies Stewart's snake-bit season, he knocked the puck toward the empty net only to have Columbus defender James Wisiniewski clear the disc away at the last possible instant. Television replays showed the puck was maddeningly close to being across the line when intercepted by Wisniewski's stick blade.
The folks over at the Oregon State Capitol Foundation became the proud owners of the limited edition bourbon after Buffalo Trace decide to give away their final batch to charities, the idea being that they could then auction or raffle the stuff off.
But as the economy soured and the SoFa scene declined, Rathmann left downtown and Eulipia's fancy, white tablecloths behind.

Why you should try it: This total body exercise uses a chair for balance and targets the glutes, legs and oblique muscles. The obliques flank the abdominals and are considered part of the core. Done slowly, the exercise is great for toning — speed it up and you'll reap cardio benefits too.
"Gold Rush": More Oregon connections, as Todd Hoffman, of Sandy, and his crew keep on looking for that elusive yellow stuff. Tonight, according to the Discovery show description, "With the all-important washplant prepped, the Hoffman crew is finally ready to process dirt. They install a clean-out tent with gold expert Fred Doge but a broken loader leaves them with nothing to feed the washplant. Harness' attempt to fix it aggravates his back injury. With the team mechanic forced to abandon them for medical help, the loader repair is left to a pair of local mechanics." At the rate things are going, it's not so much a gold rush as it is a gold stagger. (9 p.m., Discovery)
Agriculture has become a tourist draw in Hawaii, which imports about 85 percent of its food but used to export almost everything it grew -- tons of pineapples and sugar cane. Yes, the beaches are a draw, and, sure, some people still want to see hula and go to a luau.

On that site currently is an auto-repair facility that also rents out parking space to upwards of 25 cars nightly, which I have personally seen parked there very recently. Where would these car owners find space to park should this development be approved by the town's Zoning Board? More problematic to our neighborhood's parking problems would be the approval of this Meridia Le Boulevard Development that would have only 107 provided parking spaces for 123 rental units, 18 of which would be two-bedroom units.

Hey, Joe: As I wrote, the best deals are in the eye of the beholder. It's all a matter of preference between the golf course, the price and proximity. Rarely would I drive 40 or 50 miles to play unless I really liked the course and the price was right, say in the $20-25 range. So, take your pick from any of the clubs that fall into that price range. In this age of exorbitant fuel prices I prefer to stay closer to home. I'd rather spend my money on greens fees than gas and I don't need 7,000 yards of golf course to challenge me.
A: Doug Manchester and I met in 1981 in the early days of my YPO career, and I was drawn immediately to his energy, vision and significant willpower. In the mid-1990s we did some preliminary work together on a real estate development in Vietnam, but the Asian financial crisis killed that project. When I converted to Catholicism 15 years ago, I asked "Papa Doug" to be my godfather, and a few years ago, we traveled to Vatican City and he arranged for us to meet Pope Benedict XVI.

Gov.Martin O'Malley's effort to cut back on tax loopholes is a necessary step to reduce the state's income tax, and eliminating the mortgage interest income tax deduction is a good place to start ("Realtors to rally against proposed change affecting Md. mortgage interest deduction," Feb 28). While supporters of the deduction say it is an incentive to homeownership and crucial to maintain the housing market, the deduction has done very little to increase homeownership rates and is an unnecessary government subsidy of the housing market.

When you've found a nanny you love, it's important to do some official fact-checking. As you check a nanny's references, you'll want to ask challenging and specific questions. For instance, ask a reference to reveal one bad thing about their experience with the nanny. Find out how often the nanny was unable to come to work. Ask the reference if they've ever checked up on the nanny. To get a sense of a nanny's engagement level for the child she cared for, ask her reference what outings she arranged for the child and if she arranged playdates.

Sarah Michelle Gellar of "Ringer" in a tie-dyed Monique Lhuillier is sure to split opinion, but we though it was beautiful and high-spirited. "Homeland" star Morena Baccarin's daring T-shaped neckline turned heads, as did "The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo" star Rooney Mara's. "Covert Affairs" doubled-down on the drama with a voluminous ballgown skirt and bodice with a wide neckline and sheeer panel. Katherine McPhee wore a pretty tea-length frock -- the better to show off, what, six-inch heels? And how did Sofia Vergara of "Modern Family" manage to walk at all in a second-skin Vera Wang gown with an extreme fishtail hem? Not that we're complaining.

Soon after, Facebook purchased 750 patents from IBM and spent an additional half-billion dollars on part of the AOL patent portfolio recently bought by Microsoft. Meanwhile, Apple, Google, Oracle and other tech giants are locked in patent lawsuits.
The Billikens, like the Badgers, employ multiple half-court sets, rely on a point guard to orchestrate them and, if everything goes according to plan, milk some 30 seconds off the 35-second shot clock. It is no accident that Saint Louis held No. 8 seed Memphis to 54 points Friday in the Billikens' opening round game. That is exactly 20 points less than Memphis averaged per game this season.

Here's one example for reducing water use from my own experience. When we wanted hot water, say to take a shower or wash the dishes, we would turn on the faucet and wait – a long time – for the hot water to show up. We installed a water pump, with a timer, that keeps the water circulating at desired times, Turn on the faucet and the hot water arrives in about three seconds. I estimate this saves about 10 gallons of water every day, thus nearly 4,000 gallons a year. Multiply that by just 1,000 houses adding this feature, and the annual water consumption is reduced by 4 million gallons.

Disney's decision to open the film overseas before it hit U.S. theaters helped to turn the movie's debut into a worldwide event.

Problem is, Afghans are not quite as sophisticated in interpreting American intraparty maneuvering. This kind of Washington nuance does not translate into Pashto. They hear about an American departure date and they think about what will happen to them when the Americans leave. The Taliban will remain, and what they lack in popular support - they poll only 6 percent - they make up in terror: When they return to a village, they kill "collaborators" mercilessly, and publicly.
But I want to urge my supporters to continue fighting the good fight – with real weapons, if necessary. I especially urge my many gun-nut supporters to do what you have to do – and nobody, including most juries, could possibly hold you responsible for your actions.
Bonds were for the most part a better investment than stocks until the Fed lifted the cap on rates in 1951. That year the tide reversed and stocks outperformed bonds by 25 percentage points, according to Barclays. Aside from recession years, that trend of outperformance by stocks continued over the course of the decade. (It was 1954, incidentally, when the Dow Jones Industrial Average finally regained its pre-1929-crash level.)
Excerpt: This time around, the debate is spurred by the enormous amounts of cash suddenly tossed around by TV networks. And because head coaches rake in millions of dollars each year. And also â€” let's not overlook this â€” because when guys like Terrelle Pryor are trading autographs and game-worn gear for tattoos and cash, we begin to wonder: Maybe it's a dumb move, a signature for permanent body ink, but why can't he trade on his name? Why shouldn't LaMichael James and Darron Thomas and the Rodgers brothers get something for what they give on Saturdays? Haven't they earned it? Who could possibly be against the idea?
The Timbers had their chances, but even with their fair share of set pieces they weren't able to convert as they took their third straight loss and second in a row at home.
Growing up in Connecticut, our family dinners revolved around thick grilled steaks, roasted chickens, the occasional boiled lobster. And I was bored almost beyond eating. It was the late 1960s: New flavors and foods were rushing onto the nation's table with the same vigor as the new fashions and the new politics. Given this was the age both of Aquarius and the picket sign, I raised my voice loudly in protest.
"I wanted to work on being more of a leader," Aldridge said in a television interview from the court after the game. "Tonight, I was talking all game."

Lars and Bianca in "Lars and the Real Girl" (2007): Ryan Gosling had a breakout year in 2011, but that's just when more people discovered him; he's always been good. This film is proof: He plays Lars, a shy man who announces to his brother and sister-in-law that he has a new friend named Bianca -- who is, in fact, an inflatable sex doll. Gosling is tremendous and heartbreaking, and the film an underrated gem.

It might be better to do what MTV did with "Laguna Beach," later "The Hills" -- break off the standouts into series of their own. Nicole "Snooki" Polizzi and Jenni "JWoww" Farley have already been busy pitching their ideas -- Snooki with a dating show, a la VH1's "I Love New York," only trashier, and JWoww with a "Shore"-style show, only set in the Hamptons. And trashier.

Your 17-year-old boy is not only still a minor, but also does not have the financial and institutional standing to support himself. Instead, he lives at home, becoming an adult incrementally on his parents' dime. It makes no sense for parents to absorb the money and decision-making burdens of adulthood while just handing their kids the perks. If Junior wants to play house, then he can rent house. If he doesn't like the back seat, then he can be abstinent.

Backers of the platform plank argue that full support for same-sex marriage could motivate Democratic constituencies and potentially appeal to independents.

On the upside, the sector provides lots of jobs for workers with little special education or training. When the industry is thriving, it expands and hires quickly. But those positions often come with low pay and minimal benefits: On average, leisure-and-hospitality workers make a little more than $11 an hour, according to the U.S. Labor Department. Manufacturing jobs, on average, pay about twice that.
Four years later, the protections remain in limbo because of confusion and bureaucratic delays.

The whole point of becoming self sufficient in energy — as well as importing crude from friendly Canada — is to become indifferent to crude purchased from countries that want to destroy us. Oil prices are set by global demand. If we produced additional crude so that global productive capacity is in excess of demand, world crude prices would fall, and as Mr Corredoira correctly observes, OPEC would be forced to cut production to maintain prices. However, OPEC members are not all equals in terms of production and population. Countries such as Nigeria cannot cut production because they have an immediate need for cash.

The NFL knows a painful day is coming. With help from places such as the Boston University center, and more education, we're learning more about the effects of concussions and brain damage. We're learning frightening things and the league has publicly acknowledged the link itself, and taken some measures to help try to protect its current players. But a court someday is going to put a number on the neglect the league demonstrated for years.

While nearly everyone loves the new home, it's still going to be hard to build up the traditions that were left behind in Florida.
Irvin believed there was a chance he would be a late first-round pick. But his conversations with the Seahawks were limited to a long talk at the combine. There were no visits to Seattle or special meetings arranged.

That's the sort of spunk that movement conservatives want and need to see and hear â€” and more than just from Palin, who's now more a celebrity than a politician. Someone needs to pick up her combative mantle and take the fight directly to Obama and the Democrats.

Republicans say the cuts to food stamps would be modest when compared with the explosive growth of the program in recent years. Costs have more than tripled in the past decade, going from $21 billion in 2002 to $76 billion last year, with participation rising from 19 million people 10 years ago to more than 46 million at the beginning of this year. The GOP plan would lower projected costs by about 4 percent.

There are obvious reasons to criticize the Dolans and the Indians: drafting, talent evaluation, drafting, player development in some cases and -- most of all -- drafting. Beating the owners-are-too-cheap drum is an oversimplification in a sport without a salary cap and in a city struggling in a tough economy.

It is illegal to use state campaign funds, regulated under Ohio law, for a federal campaign, regulated under federal law. Simply put, if you want to run for Ohio dog catcher (a fictional post), you must follow Ohio law, and if you then decide to run for Congress -- or even just want to consider such a run -- you must file paperwork with the FEC, start a federal account and steer clear of mingling the money you raised running for dog catcher. The law keeps candidates from doing an end-run around federal campaign funding restrictions.

Claims to the contrary not withstanding, the resolution introduced in the Senate for tougher sanctions against Iran is a call to war ("Senators: Get tough on Iran," Feb. 26). The extreme sanctions presently in place being just short of war now, what else could it mean?
øSince not all student loans participate in IBR or loan forgiveness, you could certainly ask your lender about a graduated payment. Graduated payments result in a lower payment for a pre-determined amount of time, but the payments will eventually increase. This could make sense if you felt something will change in your financial situation. Make sure to ask the lender in advance what your payment will be when it increases, because it will be necessary to have the income to meet this payment further down the road.

Lautenberg noted other opponents -- like congressional Republicans who voted almost unanimously against the stimulus money -- focus on the deficit the spending will help increase. But Lautenberg said that is "almost minuscule" compared with the scope of the recession.
"It is unfortunately not surprising to see more effusive praise for Russia's leaders coming from the White House," policy director Lanhee Chen said. "President Obama has utterly failed to stand up to Russia on issues ranging from Iran's nuclear weapons program to Syria to Russia's own backsliding into authoritarianism. At the same time, he's given away concession after concession to Russia. We can expect more such â€˜flexibility' if President Obama is re-elected."

But as Louis-Dreyfus finished her "Seinfeld" story, walked back into the ornate make-believe offices of Vice President Meyer on that Columbia soundstage and started sounding decidedly duplicitous and scheming in the lines she spoke, I couldn't help wondering if this high-buzz HBO series wasn't in some small way, at least, Elaine goes to Washington — with some of the smartest guys in American and British pop culture driving the limousine.

Gingrich drops names of the intellectual and political elite he has known and boldly lays claim to a major share of the legacy of two presidents, Reagan and Clinton. He brags that his candidacy is so historically significant and so utterly different from any other that it is nearly incomprehensible to the dullards in the media. In front of the South Carolina Chamber of Commerce, after presenting a litany of intractable problems faced by the nation, he said of himself, "If you have a leader who knows what he is doing, we can turn this around in a year."
The White House has supported legislation proposed by Sen. Joe Lieberman, which empowers the Department of Homeland Security to adopt security standards for critical infrastructure networks, such as our power systems, transportation systems and communications networks. Republicans argue that the bill is "too regulatory" in imposing standards on industry. Led by Sen. John McCain, eight Republican senators have proposed competing legislation that would encourage sharing information about cyberthreats among private entities, including Internet service providers such as Comcast and AT&T, online providers such as Google and Amazon, and companies ranging from PG&E to Exxon. The bill would also encourage these private entities to share cyberthreat information with government agencies through incentives such as protection against lawsuits.
